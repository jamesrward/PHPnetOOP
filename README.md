# PHP.net OOP5

Working my way through the OOP5 examples on [php.net](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php)

My goals are to gain a better understanding of the OOP standards in modern PHP as well as work on my ability to navigate 
PHPStorm effectively.  I'm working towards setting my PHPStorm keymap to mimic Atom as closely as possible while still
maintaining all of the code completion goodness PHPStorm has to offer.  If there is any interest I may publich my
keymap when I am done as well.

Where example will not run in the terminal I am trying to insert the code necessary to get them to run.  I want each
example to be runnable on it's own with no includes but we will see how long that lasts.
